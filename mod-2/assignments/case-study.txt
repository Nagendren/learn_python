in the banking market of Thailand.  The verification process for opening a bank account is done manually 
by reviewing the photocopy of the approved ID card. However, they have recently introduced a system where 
the customers’ fingerprint will be mapped with the newly introduced Unique ID for citizens of Thailand by 
the government. FinBank should implement a system that verifies customers against the fingerprint and Unique Id. 

Key issues
